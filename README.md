# Connectify üëàüèª

Connectify is a dynamic online social networking application designed to connect you with like-minded individuals and thought leaders. On Connectify, you can share posts, insights, and achievements, fostering meaningful interactions and inspiring mutual growth within a vibrant community.


# Key FeaturesüöÄ
1. The backend is developed using the Spring and Spring Boot frameworks of java and adopted MySQL database for robust data management.
2. Implement Authentication of user using Jwt token and adopted spring security to secure API endpoints based on roles.
3. Hibernate is used for performing crud operations on databases and adopted hibernate query language for complex queries
implementations.
4. Adopted sophisticated REST API architecture designed for scalability, security, and high performance.
5. Implemented a exception handler for handling custom exception that captures and reports detailed error information, streamlining debugging and improving error transparency.

  # System Design of Application üìå
 **Layered Architecture**: </br>
 <ul> <li><b> Presentation Layer (Controller):</li> </b>
This layer handles HTTP requests, maps them to appropriate service calls, and then converts service responses into RESTful responses (often in JSON). Controllers act as the entry point for client interactions.
<li><b>Business Logic Layer (Service): </li></b>
The Service layer contains the core business logic. It performs operations such as data validation, business rule enforcement, and orchestration of calls to lower layers. This level ensures that your use-case scenarios are implemented consistently.
   <li><b> Data Access Layer (Repository): </li></b>
The Repository layer provides an abstraction for data persistence. Using Spring Data repositories (or similar), your code interacts with relational or NoSQL databases without having to write boilerplate SQL code.
   <li><b>Domain Model (Entity):</li></b>
Entities are plain old Java objects (POJOs) that map to database tables (or collections). They represent the state and data of your application, and their structure typically reflects the underlying database schema.
  <li><b>Utility/Helper Layer: </li> </b>
This layer provides common functions, such as logging, date formatting, configuration handling, exception handling, or third-party API integrations, which can be utilized across the entire application.
  <li><b> Security Layer: </li></b>
Integrate Spring Security or OAuth2 for authenticating and authorizing API requests. Security configurations can be placed in a separate config package.
  <li><b>Aspect Layer:</li> </b>This layer encapsulates logging functionality through a dedicated aspect class, which leverages pointcut expressions to intercept REST API calls, and separate pointcut expression class for writing pointcut expression.
   <li><b>Exception Layer:</li></b> This layer is responsible for centralized exception management using custom exception classes and a global exception handler. It ensures consistent and meaningful error responses across the application while improving maintainability and simplifying debugging.
</ul>
